# BGJ 2021.2
This is our submission to Brackey's Game Jam 2021.2. Explore a temple manipulated by mysterious cards. Fight your way through the skeleton hordes while trying not to weave spells that make you explode.

The majority of assets were made in house (Unfortunately, obtaining explosives isn't a very good idea, so not those).

------Tutorial and Controls------

Move with WASD

Use [M1] to shoot, and [R] to reload

When you collect a coin, press [Q] to draw a card and then [1]-[5] to put it in your gun's deck. These will modify how your gun fires (good or bad). 

As you miraculously stay alive, the cards in your deck will naturally become more unstable, so make sure you're keeping watch of their instability percentage!
